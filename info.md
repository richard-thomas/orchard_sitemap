## Introduction

This map is primarily designed for members of the orchard to explore the variety of plants and habitats across the orchard site, zooming in on areas of interest. If viewed on site (using a mobile phone or tablet), GPS can be used to display on the map where you are within the orchard (see 'geolocation' below). The first thing you will want to do is to turn the map key display off (see 'toggle map key' below) to see more of the map!

## Web Map Instructions

The web map (if not already opened) can be opened with the **[View the map]** button at the top of this page.

**Map buttons** (down the left hand side):

- ( i ) (information icon) show this information page within the map (click again to hide the page)
- [+] zoom in (or use scroll wheel, pinch-zoom or double-click)
- [-] zoom out (or use scroll wheel, pinch-zoom)
- [&#x21D1;] (hidden unless map has been rotated): re-align north to up
- [&#x22B3;] geolocation: display a map marker at your current location
- [&equiv;] (at bottom of map): toggle the map key display on/off

**Other Mouse/Touch controls**:

- To rotate the map (on a desktop): Alt + Shift + (drag with mouse)
- To rotate the map (on a phone or tablet): use 2 fingers with a twisting action
- To scroll the map key pane (on a desktop): use the scrollbar, or use mouse wheel while hovering over it

**Initial Data Loading**: note that with a slow network connection, the data layers may initially take a while to load as all data is loaded into the web browser at start-up. However, after that point (and on future visits to the web page if the data is still in the browser cache), the only data loaded over the network will be imagery for any base layer that is turned on, so data layer features should render quickly.

**Offline Map Usage**: Because the data layers are all loaded at start-up, if you keep the web map browser tab open (or if you re-visit the website and it is still in your browser cache), you can continue to use the web map when you do not have a network connection. You would only need a network connection to update the base layer map.

The rest of the data was gathered by Richard Thomas from an earlier orchard map (drawn in Microsoft Word), but largely from new survey of the orchard contents and discussion with other MRCO members. Feature spatial locations were partly mapped using a professional GPS survey tool on loan from the Parks Department of Bristol City Council.
